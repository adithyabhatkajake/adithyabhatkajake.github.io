Robinhood claims that they offer $5\%$ APY by subscribing to Robinhood Gold at $5 per month.
Meanwhile, Capital One offers $4.3\%$ APY for free.
Let us measure how much money we need to deposit in order for Robinhood to be more profitable.

Let $x$ be the amount of money we have.
By depositing \$X in Capital One, we have $1.043x$ at the end of the year.
If we deposited the same amount in Robinhood Gold, we will have $1.05x-(12*5)$ at the end of the year.
Solving for $1.05x-60>1.043x$, we get $x>8571.43$ [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=1.05x-60%3E1.043x][[1]â€‹]].

So, if you have more than \$8600 in cash hanging around, Robinhood Gold makes more money than Capital One.
