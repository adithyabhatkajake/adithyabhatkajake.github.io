* Bio 🤦🏻
I am Adithya Bhat, a distributed systems enthusiast while I am on a computer, a travel enthusiast during warmer weathers, and a food enthusiast during winters.
I am currently working as a Staff Research Scientist at Visa Research.
I obtained my Ph.D. from Purdue University with Prof. Aniket Kate as my advisor.
My favorite programming language is Rust, favorite editor is Emacs, and favorite hobby is travelling to local fairs, playing ping pong, pickleball, and reading books.
